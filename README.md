## Enabling Erasure Coding in Disaggregated Memory Systems

### 1. Introduction
Disaggregated memory (DM) separates compute and memory resources to build a huge memory pool. Erasure coding (EC) is expected to provide fault tolerance in DM with low memory cost. In DM with EC, objects are first coded in compute servers, then directly written to memory servers via high-speed networks like one-sided RDMA. However, as the one-sided RDMA latency goes down to the microsecond level, coding overhead degrades the performance in DM with EC.
To enable efficient EC in DM, we thoroughly analyze the coding stack from the perspective of cache efficiency and RDMA transmission. We develop MicroEC, which optimizes the coding workflow by reusing the auxiliary coding data and coordinates the coding and RDMA transmission with an exponential pipeline, as well as carefully adjusting the coding and transmission threads to minimize the latency.
We implement a prototype supporting common basic operations, such as write/read/degraded read/recovery. Experiments show that MicroEC reduces the write latency by up to 44.35% and 42.14% and achieves up to 1.80x and 1.73x write throughput, compared with the state-of-the-art DM systems with EC and 3-way replication for objects not smaller than 1MB, respectively.
For small objects, MicroEC also evidently reduces the variation of latency, e.g., it reduces the P99 latency of writing 1KB objects by 27.81%.

### 2. Overview
* MicroEC prototype is written in Java based on [Crail-1.3](https://github.com/apache/incubator-crail)
* MicroEC coding library is written in C based on [ISA-L](https://github.com/intel/isa-l)
* [Introduction to Crail](https://crail.incubator.apache.org/)

### 3. Requirements
* gcc >=4.7, nasm>= 2.15, make>=3.8
* Java >= 1.8 (Oracle JVMS have been tested)
* RDMA-based network, e.g., Infiniband, iWARP, RoCE.
* libdisni.so, available as part of [DiSNI](https://github.com/zrlio/disni)
* [Apache Maven 3.6.3](https://github.com/apache/maven/tree/maven-3.6.3)

### 4. Installation

* Get the source code of MicroEC.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ADSL-EC/MicroEC.git
```

* MicroEC coding leverages [ISA-L(Intel(R) Intelligent Storage Acceleration Library](https://github.com/intel/isa-l/tree/v2.30.0) to perform fundamental coding computation. It provides a dynamically linked library *libmicroec.so*. The compilation commands are listed below.

```sh
# 1. intall isa-l
$ cd MicroEC/isa-l
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure; make; sudo make install

# 2. compile for libmicroec.so
$ javac MicroEC/client/src/main/java/org/apache/crail/tools/Crailcoding.java
$ javah MicroEC/client/src/main/java/org.apache.crail.tools.Crailcoding
$ sudo cp MicroEC/client/src/main/java/org_apache_crail_tools_Crailcoding.h MicroEC/client/src/main/java/org/apache/crail/tools/
$ cd MicroEC/client/src/main/java/org/apache/crail/tools
$ g++ -std=c++11 -I/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_221/include -I/usr/java/jdk1.8.0_221/include/linux -fPIC -shared microec.c -o libmicroec.so -L.  /usr/lib/libisal.so
```

Then you will find `libmicroec.so` under the path `MicroEC/client/src/main/java/org/apache/crail/tools`.

* Compile MicroEC prototype.

```sh
$ cd MicroEC
$ mvn -DskipTests clean install
```

* Copy tarball from `assembly/target` to the cluster and unpack it using `tar xvfz apache-crail-1.3-incubating-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz`.

### 5. Minimal Configuration for Testing the Prototype
* To configure Crail use the `*.template` files as a basis and modify it to match your environment. Set the `$CRAIL_HOME` environment variable to your Crail deploymentâ€™s path.
* There are 3 configuration files in the config folder.

#### slaves

This file is used by the start/stop-crail.sh script to ease running/stopping Crail on multiple machines. Each line should contain a hostname where a storage tier is supposed to be started. Set the mapping relations from IPs to hostnames in /etc/hostname.

Here is an example.

```sh
node2
node3
node4
...
```

* Copy `libdisni.so` and `libmicroec.so` into `$CRAIL_HOME/lib/`
